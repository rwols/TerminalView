Please provide the following information when logging a bug:

* OS used
* ST3 version
* Bash version
* Arguments being used with the terminal_view_open command
* If possible, a dump of the environment vars from the terminal view (call `env` in the terminal inside ST3)
* Anything else you can think of that might help

and keep in mind that this plugin is maintained in my spare time so be patient.
